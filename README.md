Quick and dirty stopwords list for Yiddish, made from the most common words in a scrape of the Yiddish Book Center's OCR data. Note: this will not be effective for all orthographies!

Have now begun adding both combined and precombined forms. In order to make one big list which will work on a lot of texts (which I am working on doing), the list will need to be very long, incorporating both orthographic and encoding variations.
